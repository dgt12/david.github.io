The [3MT Doctoral Competition](https://www.waikato.ac.nz/students/research-degrees/3-minute-thesis-3mt-competitions/3mt-doctoral) challenges students to summarise their thesis in three minutes to a non-specialist audience.

Abstract: Visualisations can be extremely helpful for making sense of data. My research investigates novel techniques for visualising both categories and sets. I am currently applying these techniques to language data in order to better understand how te reo MƒÅori is used on Twitter and in New Zealand newspaper articles.
