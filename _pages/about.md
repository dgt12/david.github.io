I recently submitted my PhD thesis in Computer Science at the [University of Waikato](https://www.waikato.ac.nz/), based in Hamilton, New Zealand. My research focused on developing novel visualisation techniques for categorical data and demonstrating their effectiveness through applications in linguistics.

**I have recently moved to the UK and am actively seeking a role in Data Science or Software Engineering.** Please click [here](http://dgt12.github.io/files/trye_cv.pdf) to download my CV. I am currently based in Southend but open to relocating to any city in the UK. Feel free to reach out if you have any opportunities or would like to know more! 

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, travelling, playing games (but weirdly, not gaming), exploring the outdoors and generally keeping active. Did I mention I have a chocolate addiction? 
My family and friends can attest to my razor-sharp wit and likeability, not to mention my modesty!

As a self-professed language nerd from Aotearoa, I have researched aspects of New Zealand English (NZE) and [te reo MƒÅori](http://www.maorilanguage.info/mao_lang_desc1.html). Check out [Kiwi Words](https://kiwiwords.cms.waikato.ac.nz/) for more information about related projects.
