As part of my PhD research, I designed and implemented MultiCat, a novel visualisation technique for exploring categorical data. I mastered the basics of Svelte so that I could create a web-based prototype for demonstration purposes. You can [try it out for yourself](https://dgt12.github.io/multicat/) or [read more about it](https://dgt12.github.io/files/multicat.pdf).
