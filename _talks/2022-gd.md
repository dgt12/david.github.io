PAOHVis ([Valdivia et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2933196)) displays hypergraphs in a matrix where rows represent nodes (dots) and columns represent hyperedges (vertical lines). We propose extensions to PAOHVis for leveraging repeated hyperedges in non-simple hypergraphs, and displaying multiple node attributes. This is accomplished through two aggregation functions: count-based, which targets low-level detail, and binary, for high-level overview. In doing so, we introduce a domain-agnostic framework for consolidating hypergraphs by one or more categorical node attributes.
