I'm studying towards a PhD in Computer Science at the [University of Waikato](https://www.waikato.ac.nz/), based in Hamilton, New Zealand (not far from [Hobbiton](https://www.hobbitontours.com/))! 

My long-suffering supervisors are [Professor Mark Apperley](https://profiles.waikato.ac.nz/mark.apperley), [Professor David Bainbridge](https://profiles.waikato.ac.nz/david.bainbridge) and [Dr Andreea Calude](https://profiles.waikato.ac.nz/andreea.calude). Against their better judgement, they're helping me to develop **novel visualisation techniques for exploring categorical and set-based data**. (I won't bore you with the details; just know that my work is crucial to humanity and, like all PhDs, will most definitely "transform the way we think or act".)

Being a self-professed linguistics nerd, I'm particularly interested in applying my very important techniques (VITs?) to language analysis. More often than not, that means I'm working with New Zealand English (NZE) or [te reo MƒÅori](http://www.maorilanguage.info/mao_lang_desc1.html), the Indigenous language of Aotearoa New Zealand. Check out our [Kiwi Words website](https://kiwiwords.cms.waikato.ac.nz/) for more information about related projects.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, travelling, playing games (but weirdly, not gaming), exploring the outdoors and generally keeping active. My family and friends can attest to my razor-sharp wit and likeability (not to mention my modesty). 

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to know more!

\*PhD stands for "Please help David", preferably before his next breakdown.
